## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes retail fashion sales data to uncover insights into revenue performance, customer behavior, product profitability, and seasonal trends.

The goal was to transform raw, messy data into a business-ready dataset and deliver actionable insights through SQL and Power BI.

## 🎯 Objectives

✔️ Understand overall business performance

✔️ Identify top-performing products, regions, and customers

✔️ Analyze profitability vs revenue

✔️ Investigate return patterns and risks

✔️ Detect seasonal trends for forecasting

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

📑 Excel- Initial preprocessing & cleaning

🗄️ SQL Server (SSMS)- Data cleaning & analysis

📊 Power BI- Dashboard & visualization

## 🗂️ Dataset & Data Model
### 🧾 Dataset
- **Source**: [Messy Retail Fashion Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanpatangan/retail-fashion-data)
- **Format**: `.csv` file

### This project uses a relational database structure:

👤 Customers → demographics

🛍️ Products → pricing & attributes

💳 Sales → transactions

🏬 Stores → location data

🔗 Connected using Primary & Foreign Keys

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
### ✔️ Key Steps
Replaced missing values (Discount → 0, Email → "Unknown")

Standardized categories (??? → Unknown)

Ensured correct data types (IDs, prices, dates)

Maintained referential integrity (added "Unknown" customer)

Verified no duplicates in primary keys

Performed outlier detection → no unrealistic values found

Saved Clean CSV- Saved each dataset as UTF-8 CSV

💡 Result: Clean, analysis-ready dataset

## 🧠 Feature Engineering

💰 Revenue Calculation

```bash
Revenue = Quantity * ListPrice * (1 - Discount)
```

👉 Converts raw transactional data into business value (money)

### 🧩 SQL View (Master Dataset)
```bash
CREATE VIEW Sales_Analysis AS
SELECT 
    s.TransactionID,
    s.Date,
    s.CustomerID,
    s.ProductID,
    s.StoreID,
    s.Quantity,
    s.Discount,
    s.Returned,

    c.Age,
    c.Gender,
    c.City,

    p.Category,
    p.Color,
    p.Size,
    p.Season,
    p.Supplier,
    p.CostPrice,
    p.ListPrice,

    st.StoreName,
    st.Region,
    st.StoreSize_m2,

    (s.Quantity * p.ListPrice * (1 - s.Discount)) AS Revenue

FROM Sales s
JOIN Customers c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
JOIN Stores st ON s.StoreID = st.StoreID;
```

💥 One clean dataset → ready for analysis & Power BI
